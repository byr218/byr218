            <h1>My name is Byron Engelbrecht</h1>
            <p>I am a freshman non-traditional student pursuing a degree in Cyber Security. 
                <br></br>
                My only formal coding training was a couple semesters of C++ at a community college in New Jersey many years ago. 
                <br></br>
                I like to travel and spend my free time being physically active.
